# Digital System Design

Stopwatch is a digital counter created entirely within Logisim. Activate ticks, hold down the reset button, and on release the mod-5 counter will begin to increase. The "But" button will cause the counter to reverse direction upon hitting a specific number 

The file stopwatch.circ is intended to be loaded with logisim-evolution (https://github.com/reds-heig/logisim-evolution). 

Vending Machine is a simulated vending machine intended to run on EPFL "Gecko" FPGAs. You can open the files in Modelsim or Quartus and run some scripts to see how the system works.
