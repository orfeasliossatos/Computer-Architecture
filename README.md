# Computer Architecture

This is a collection of computer architecture projects I carried out during my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at EPFL and the University of Edinburgh. 

We used Logisim, Modelsim, and Quartus to program EPFL "Gecko" FPGAs, simulating various digital systems - a vending machine, the Game of Life, an interrupt handler, a multicycle processor, and a pipelined processor. Designed by professors Paolo Ienne (paolo.ienne@epfl.ch), Mirjana Stojilovic (mirjana.stojilovic@epfl.ch), and Ties Jan Henderikus Kluter (ties.kluter@epfl.ch), these projects were carried out in collaboration with Henrique Da Silva Gameiro (henrique.dasilvagameiro@epfl.ch), Kelvin Kappeler (kelvin.kappeler@epfl.ch), and Alexis Favre (alexis.favre@epfl.ch).

In the University of Edinburgh I studied parallel architectures under Vijayanand Nagarajan, producing two written reports. The first is an evaluation of past predictions of future processors. The second is an investigation into the Coherence and Consistency guarentees of DICE computers at the University of Edinburgh.
